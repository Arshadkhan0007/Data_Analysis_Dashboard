# Data_Analysis_Dashboard
## Question (KPI's)
- What is the relationship between average income and bike purchases
- Customers within what age are more likely to purchase a bike
- How much difference does it make if a customer already owns a car
- Is there any relationship between commute distance and bike purchases
- Customers with what occupation are more likely to purchase bike

##Process Overview
The project follows a structured approach to analyze and visualize data:
Data Collection: The dataset is sourced and prepared for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, removing dublicate values and standardizing formats.
Data Processing: Applying relevant transformations for better insights that is, added certain collumns for enhanced comprehension.
Visualization & Dashboarding: Creating interactive dashboards for easier interpretation.
Insight Generation: Analyzing key trends and patterns.
Final Review & Reporting: Summarizing key findings and making actionable recommendations.

##Dashboard
A user-friendly dashboard has been created to visualize key metrics, making data analysis intuitive and efficient. The dashboard includes:
Summary View: An overview of critical metrics and trends that includes
Filter Options: Interactive elements to customize data views.
Graphical Representations: Charts, graphs, and tables to display key findings.
Performance Metrics: KPIs highlighted for easy tracking.

##Project Insights
The analysis provided meaningful insights into the dataset, such as:
Trends & Patterns:
- People between the ages of 30 and 55 are more likely to buy a bike.
- The increase in commute distance negatively impacts the bike sales.
- Customers with cars generally avoid purchasing a bike.
Comparative Analysis: Evaluating different segments for better decision-making.
- Customers with Professional occupation are the most likely ro purchase a bike and customer with skilled manual occupation are a the least likely to purchase a bike.
- Male customer are more likely to purchase a bike than female customers.

##Final Conclusion
This project successfully transformed raw data into actionable insights through structured analysis and visualization. The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface to interpret key metrics efficiently. By leveraging these insights, users can make informed decisions and improve performance effectively.
For further improvements, future iterations can focus on automation, real-time updates, and deeper predictive analytics to enhance decision-making capabilities
